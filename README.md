# tdd-strict-equal

When submitting your assignment, include answers to the following.

#Identify the component of this assignment that you did the best on, and why.
I am not sure. I am still learning. I feel like every part of this assignment was a learning process and a struggle.

#Describe in plain english what problem this assignment was posing, and what your solution was to it.
The problem this assignment posed was to create a function that will evaluate whether each character was equal to one another. 

#What was your approach or process?
My approach was to create the first part of the function and then determine what I need to write the tests, but my npm test command never worked on my device. 

#What were your challenges?
My challenges were learning node and how to use it, learning the syntax of it, and how to use external libraries and installing them. 

#What resources did you use?
I used google to figure out my errors. I couldn't contact TA's because I worked on this late at night. I also watched recordings of this week and office hours recordings.
